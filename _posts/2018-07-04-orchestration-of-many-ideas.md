title: Orchestration of many ideas
---
OK, I have a few study plans up my sleeve. Infact I have a lot of things I wish to learn.
I have used Puppet, Chef, Ansible & Salt. I have used LXD & Docker, Kubernetes; KVM, VMWare & Citrix - it's a horrible mess of information, what are the best solutions to my problems? All of the above are great tools, but the selection needs to be appropriate.

If you have mastered one software then what is to say there is a change of modus operandi and you find yourself limited due to hardware, time and money but expectations are for you to dive in and rebuild your entire infrastructure.

Well, there is no magic wand. If you are like me, you'll want the knowledge downloaded directly in to the brain in a way that is not too dis-similar to Neo learning Kung-Fu in The Matrix. Sadly, it requires dedicated time, hairloss and practice to be able to wield the tools... Oh and possibly more hairloss depending on external factors such as software features. The real problem is when you have a very poor attention span and are bad when it comes to commiting to an idea to follow it through. 

The only guidence I can give is to keep it simple and ask your self what you wish to achieve.

**What do you want to acheive?**

**What software will do the job well**

**Create a lab environment for each one**

**Devote time in to learning the software if previously not known*

**Plan how you would roll it out**

**Build a business case for the change and any expenses**

**Get someone to proof read**
