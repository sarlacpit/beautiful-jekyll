title: Orchestration of many ideas
---
OK, I have a few study plans up my sleeve. Infact I have a lot of things I wish to learn.
I have used Puppet, Chef, Ansible & Salt. I have used LXD & Docker, Kubernetes; KVM, VMWare & Citrix - it's a horrible mess of information, what are the best solutions to my problems? All of the above are great tools, but the selection needs to be appropriate.

If you have mastered one software then what is to say there is a change of modus operandi and you find yourself limited due to hardware, time and money but expectations are for you to dive in and rebuild your entire infrastructure.

Well, there is no magic wand. If you are like me, you'll want the knowledge downloaded directly in to the brain in a way that is not too dis-similar to Neo learning Kung-Fu in The Matrix. Sadly, it requires dedicated time, hairloss and practice to be able to wield the tools... Oh and possibly more hairloss depending on external factors such as software features. The real problem is when you have a very poor attention span and are bad when it comes to commiting to an idea to follow it through. 

The only guidence I can give is to keep it simple and ask your self what you wish to achieve.

**What do you want to acheive?**
List it down.

**What software will do the job well**
Use the Internet, reach out... ask Twitter, Redit. Use Slack channels.
Don't just wade in to the first software because it is trendy. It might not be appropriate for various reasons. 

**Devote time in to learning the software if previously not known**
This goes hand in hand with creating your lab and can slow down your progress a lot of the time as other day to day tasks get in the way. Meetings, faults, projects etc. Look in to blocking some time in your calander where you can sit in a comms room somewhere you wont be disturbed. I try and  for two hours a day but what ever works for you. You could also use the Pomodoro technique if you find your attention span waivers alot.

**Get proof of concept**
Most software has some freely available documentation online. From official documentation to blogs and man pages. Build your lab in an isolated network - this way you wont shaft anything. Document your labs especially any diffuculties or stumbling blocks. I sometimes use my bash history to retrace my steps and put it all in to a shell script which will allow me to recreate the desired state. Use snapshots if available regularly. Think of it like gaming and reaching a save point. This way - if it goes 'tits up', you can reset.

**Plan your deployment**
The fine points... What money do you need to spend? Draft a simple diagram of how it will work.


**Build a business case for the change and any expenses**

**Get someone to proof read**
