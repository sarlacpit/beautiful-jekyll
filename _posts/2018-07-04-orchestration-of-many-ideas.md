title: Orchestration of many ideas
---
OK, I have a few study plans up my sleeve. Infact I have a lot of things I wish to learn.
I have used Puppet, Chef, Ansible & Salt. I have used LXD & Docker, Kubernetes; KVM, VMWare & Citrix - it's a horrible mess of information, what are the best solutions to my problems? All of the above are great tools, but your selection needs to be appropriate.

If you have mastered one software then what is to say there is a change of modus operandi and you find yourself limited due to hardware, time and money but expacted to dive in and rebuild your entire stack (actually - i am not comforable saying stack yet so i'll say say infrastructure next time).

Well, there is no magic wand. If you are like me, you'll want the knowledge downloaded directly in to the brain in a way that is not too dis-similar to Neo learning Kung-Fu in The Matrix. Sadly, it requires dedicated time, hairloss and practice to be able to wield the tools... Oh and possibly more hairloss depending on external factors such as software features.
